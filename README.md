The Goal is to make all configurations avalable with IaC standard which also can be usable for companies to define standard procedures for their staff to fallow. Besides, it can make developer's life easier to create Rolebooks to write their instructions in format of code so that they can be reusable by themselves and others in future. In can also be used somehow as a part of documentations of a project.
